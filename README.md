# EMOTION_DETECTION
Simple emotion detection using machine learning 
NOTE: The model ive made is different from the one given in the video due to multiple problems:
  1. Different tensorflow versions.
  2. The incompatibility between the model_weights and the model_a.json.
There are two models:
  1. Gui.py: This trains their model based on the training data given by the user(you).
  2. Secondapproach.py: This is a pretrained model which works efficiently without the needed of training the data.
